The Python Memory Manager is responsible for allocating and freeing memory, and provides an abstraction layer over the memory allocated by the Operating System. Python uses a technique called reference counting for memory management, where it keeps track of the number of references to an object in memory. When an object's reference count reaches zero, the Python Memory Manager automatically frees the memory used by that object. Additionally, Python also has a Garbage Collector which runs periodically and collects any objects that are no longer in use and frees the memory occupied by them."
