    "# In Python, an exception is an event that interrupts the normal flow of program execution. When an error occurs during the execution of a Python program, an exception is raised which can be handled by the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Exceptions can occur due to various reasons such as runtime errors, input/output errors, arithmetic errors, and so on. When an exception occurs, Python interpreter looks for a corresponding exception handler in the program, and if it finds one, it executes it. If no exception handler is found, the program terminates and displays the exception message.\n",
    "\n",
    "# On the other hand, syntax errors are errors that occur during the parsing of the Python code. These errors occur when the code does not follow the correct syntax or grammar rules of the Python language. Syntax errors prevent the program from executing and must be fixed before the program can be run.\n",
    "\n",
    "# The main differences between exceptions and syntax errors are:\n",
    "\n",
    "# Cause: Exceptions are caused by runtime errors, while syntax errors are caused by errors in the code syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Timing: Exceptions occur during the execution of a program, while syntax errors occur before the program is executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Handling: Exceptions can be handled using try-except statements, while syntax errors must be fixed by correcting the code.\n",
